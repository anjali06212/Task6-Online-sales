# Task6-Online-sales
As part of my internship i did an SQL-based sales trend analysis project that aggregates monthly revenue and order volume from e-commerce data. Includes a sample dataset, table creation script, and aggregation query for PostgreSQL, with MySQL and SQLite compatibility to visualize trends from Jan 2023â€“Dec 2024.
